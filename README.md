RP2040-Decoder
===============

This Project is a DIY DCC Decoder for model railroad locomotives which aims to be cost effective.

Features
--------

- DCC digital signal decoding
- Motor load/speed control
- 4 Outputs to drive loads up to 400mA each
- 6 GPIO for lighter loads or custom applications
- Programmable on programming track
- CV Function Mapping
- Board size of 25x20 mm

Getting Started
------------


The ["Getting Started"](https://github.com/gab-k/RP2040-Decoder/wiki/Getting-started) page provides an overview of the steps required to use the decoder as well as brief instructions for all the necessary steps.

Further details about the project can be found here:  [RP2040-Decoder Wiki](https://github.com/GabrielKoppenstein/pico-decoder/wiki)

Note: The decoder is still in early development, there might (will) be bugs as its not tested that much yet.
So suggestions on how to improve things and bug reports are always much appreciated.
The wiki is also work in progress and will be updated to be as comprehensive as possible.

2 hardware versions is supported. By default the original board created by Gabriel is supported and by running cmake
with the following option: "-DPICO_BOARD=ilabs_opendec02" the project is setup for the iLabs OpenDec02 decoder."
